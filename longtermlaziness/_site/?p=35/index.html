          <h2>Array.forEach() &#8211; Introduction</h2>
<p class="meta">19 Apr 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>One of the most fantastic feature of JavaScript is that functions are considered as first-class objects. A first consequence of this is that it allows functional programming. One usage of functional programming is to manipulate arrays easily.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 5 has standardized some methods that existed for a while in Firefox :</p>

<ul>
<li>  every</li>
<li>  some</li>
<li>  forEach</li>
<li>  map</li>
<li>  filter</li>
<li>  reduce</li>
<li>  reduceRight</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these methods can be used instead of a common pattern of imperative programming. For example, the <code>.forEach()</code> method can be used when you are writing the following code.<br>
[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;on&quot;]<br>
// Let&#8217;s assume that &#8216;a&#8217; is an array and &#8216;f&#8217; a function previously declared<br>
var i, l;<br>
for(i=0, l=a.length ; i&lt;l; i++){<br>
f(a[i], i, a); // the order of the arguments is the one used in ES5<br>
}<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>With .forEach :</p>

<p>[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;on&quot;]<br>
// Let&#8217;s assume that &#8216;a&#8217; is an array and &#8216;f&#8217; a function previously declared<br>
a.forEach(f);<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>Somehow, each of the &#8220;Array extras&#8221; is an hidden loop.<br>
Each method has a compulsory argument which is the function (&#8220;callback function&#8221;) to be called on each array element and an optional argument which is an object used as the <code>this</code> value of the function used as first argument.<br>
Expect for <code>reduce</code> and <code>reduceRight</code>, the function used as an argument can have between 1 and 3 arguments with already defined semantics. The first argument is the element of the array, the second argument is its index and the third, the array being traversed.</p>

<p>Among the advantages of those methods we can find :</p>

<ul>
<li>  Smaller code</li>
<li>  Better abstraction (no need to read all the code to understand that the same treatment is applied to each element)</li>
<li>  No need for a loop counter. It seems minor, but it means that this JavaScript variable doesn&#8217;t need to be allocated and then garbage-collected at the end of its life-time. This should result to better performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will see in a next article that forEach and the other Array methods may not be limited to arrays.<br>
In another article about these methods, I will go further in the idea of &#8220;better abstraction&#8221; and the different advantages this better abstraction can provide in term of performance.<br>
In a last article, I will provide some code to use at the beginning of an application to be able to use these methods even in an ECMAScript 3 but not 5 compliant environment (<a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/">like IE all versions, even 9pre</a>)</p>
