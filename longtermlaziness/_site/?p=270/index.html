<p class="meta">02 Dec 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I read the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/RudeBaguette">RudeBaguette</a>&#8216;s article <a href="http://rudebaguette.com/2011/12/02/if-siri-is-hacked-in-a-french-forest-does-anybody-care/">about the silence since the Applidium&#8217;s hack</a> and it reminded me the core ideals I care about and what I fight for.</p>

<h2>The article</h2>

<p>Some folks &#8220;hacks&#8221; Siri, figured a way to use it in a way Apple hasn&#8217;t intended it for and advertised it on their blog. It creates a buzz, some people see potential (use Siri as a remote control, to turn off your car and lock it&#8230;).</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, no one talks about it anymore. The blog posts with reverse engineering details disappears. And no press cover anymore.</p>

<p>The article suggests a conspiracy as a conclusion.</p>

<h2>Apple&#8217;s world</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/mobileme/en/terms.html">Apple Terms Of Services</a>:<br>
“Apple grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Software as provided to you by Apple as a part of the Service and in accordance with these TOS; provided that you do not (and do not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, <strong>reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code (unless expressly permitted or required by law)</strong>, sell, lease, sublicense, assign, <strong>grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right in the Software</strong>.” (emphasis added)</p>

<p>No reverse engineering? No decompiling? No granting of a security interest? That&#8217;s a lot of restriction! Probably too restrictive to make Applidium&#8217;s reverse-engineering legal by Apple&#8217;s terms.</p>

<h2>Legal terms and conspiracy</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not a legal expert in any fashion, but Stéphane Distinguin declining to comment, the press stopping to cover Applidium&#8217;s hack may just be the effect of Apple applying its terms of services, it&#8217;s legal rights. A conspiracy? I don&#8217;t see any conspiracy. Just a company claiming its rights.</p>

<h2>On the right to do whatever the fuck you want with your own device and softwares</h2>

<p>So many free software institutions have been claiming this particular right for years. Idealists? Naive? Maybe. But at least, when you deal with them, you don&#8217;t need to agree that you restrict your own rights to do whatever you want with the hardware and software you buy unlike with Apple.</p>

<p>Apple does not allow you to do what you want with what you buy. If you buy an Apple device knowing that on purpose, that&#8217;s your choice. If you buy an Apple device and think there is a conspiracy whenever they remind you that you&#8217;re not allowed to do what you want with you&#8217;re device, you&#8217;re just fooling yourself.</p>

<h2>Some choices of my own</h2>

<p>As it turns out, I don&#8217;t buy Apple products. Because I want to be in control of my own life. I want to be able to hack my device to use it as a remote control (I don&#8217;t have a TV) or to turn my car off and lock it (I don&#8217;t have a car) and not being told by the company who I bought it from that I am not allowed to. I believe in Creative Commons content that people will be able to share for the purpose of education. I believe in projects like <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G">Mozilla&#8217;s Boot2Gecko</a> with which I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m never going to be told that I can&#8217;t do what I want. I believe in free software so that I don&#8217;t get fucked later on and am never in doubt of a conspiracy of any sort.</p>
