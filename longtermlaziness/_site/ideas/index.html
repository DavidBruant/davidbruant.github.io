<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>I have many ideas and not enough time to develop them all. I list in this page these ideas and welcome suggestions, propositions of collaboration, etc.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>  crawler with node.js (design already done. need time to implement) 

<ul>
<li>  Web<a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/">Dasher</a> 

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/petnames/IntroPetNames.html">PetName</a> add-on. Associate a domain name with a petname so that visiting this domain displays the petname in the address bar. When visiting a phishing domain, I can see right away that my petname is not displayed and be aware that it&#8217;s likely to be phishing. For instance, for my bank, I can display &#8221; Bank &#8221; as a petname instead of the banque domain. Could be done as a jetpack add-on as soon as the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Jetpack/Goals/2012-Goals">Awesome Bar API is released</a>. 

<ul>
<li>  A cool add-on which incorporates the notion of <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Alan_Karp/site_password/">site password</a> 

<ul>
<li>  Unique secret as add-on preference
