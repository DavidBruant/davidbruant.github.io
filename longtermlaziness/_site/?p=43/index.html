          <h2>Case study #1</h2>
<p class="meta">16 Apr 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This article will be the first of a long serie I hope.<br>
One of the purpose of this blog is education through example. Each time I find a good example of a problem solved in a way that I think I could improve, I will provide the code, examine it and show how I would the problem and justifying why I think it is better.</p>

<p>I encourage you to debate the open questions I could raise and I encourage you to submit me some code you find interesting.</p>

<p>This first case study comes from a code I have found in a website (variable names and strings have been changed).</p>

<p>[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;on&quot;]<br>
var v = new (function () {<br>
this.a = &quot;Hello &quot;;<br>
this.b = &quot;world !&quot;;<br>
/* &#8230;<br>
** More than 1250 assignments like this !<br>
<em>\</em> &#8230; */<br>
this.y = &quot;foo&quot;;<br>
this.z = &quot;bar&quot;;<br>
})();<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>

<h3>Reading the code</h3>

<p>A variable receives something. This something seems to be a new instance of the result of a function called once. It is not.<br>
It turns out that when you remove the final <code>()</code>, the result is exactly the same. When you replace the final <code>)()</code> (take the value of what is between parenthesis and call it if it&#8217;s a function) by <code>())</code> (call the function and return the value returned by the function), Opera and Firefox explain that the result of the anonymous function call is not a constructor. Indeed, nothing is returned ! Not even <code>this</code>. In this case, the default returned value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, this code means that a constructor is called. This constructor is the anonymous function between parenthesis. The final <code>()</code> is interpreted as an empty (and useless) expression.</p>

<h3>What problem are we solving, by the way ?</h3>

<p>This code is called once at the beginning. It aims at initializing an object.</p>

<p>To do this I would just have created an object in the &#8220;JSON way&#8221; :<br>
[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;on&quot;]<br>
var v = {<br>
a : &quot;Hello &quot;,<br>
b : &quot;world !&quot;,<br>
/* &#8230; */<br>
y : &quot;foo&quot;,<br>
z : &quot;bar&quot;<br>
};<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>My guess is that because I just have a unique assignment, my initialization should be faster than the 1200+ instructions of the previous constructor. Another advantage of my solution is that I got rid of the 1200+ &#8220;<code>this.</code>&#8221; which saves 6000+ characters !</p>

<h3>Experiment</h3>

<p>After putting my idea and the original one in two separate loops and comparing the times of 100, 1000 or 2000 run, my implementation turns out to be between 2 and 3 times faster. This &#8220;huge&#8221; range may be due to the high usage of strings and consequently the garbage collector which is known to be actively used on Firefox (where I ran my experiments) and whose behavior cannot be accurately predicted. </p>

<p><em>Note :</em> I have not rewritten 1200 lines of code manually. I replaced all &#8220;;&#8221; by &#8220;,&#8221; and got rid of all &#8220;this.&#8221;. Some errors occurred due to the fact that some &#8220;this.&#8221; were in the right-hand side. Those must be kept. They refer to the value of the property of the object in construction.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Smaller code, no useless code, faster code. My solution seems to be better in all aspects.</p>
