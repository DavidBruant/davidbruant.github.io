<div class="post">
<p>I was <a href="http://benlog.com/articles/2011/12/21/encryption-is-mostly-not-magic/">reading an interesting post about encryption</a> and it made me feel a need to respond on what is said about credit cards.</p>

<h2>Capabili-what?</h2>

<p>Very soon after I joined <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/">es-discuss</a>, I read some messages by Mark S. Miller. Soon enough, I watched <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/From-E-to-EcmaScript">his infoQ talk</a>. This talk introduces the notion of <strong>object capabilities</strong>. This talk and this concept blew my mind. &#8220;Modularity increases my security?&#8221;. And he also shows the problem (and a solution) of distributed secure currency. Any &#8220;smart&#8221; idea I&#8217;ll write in this post are actually more or less already in this part of the talk.</p>

<p>Unrelatedly, I watched a talk by <a href="http://youtu.be/47Ceot8yqeI">Douglas Crockford</a> which suggested people to go watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL5o4PFuxTY&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL20A37C5081563951">The Lazy Programmer&#8217;s Guide to Secure Computing</a> by Marc Stiegler which strongly emphasis POLA. <a href="http://longtermlaziness.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/open-e-mail-to-my-lazy-friend-marc-stiegler/">I did</a> and took the same sort of mind-blowing shower. I will learn later that Marc Stiegler and Mark Miller have been working together.</p>

<p>This led me to start reading <a href="http://erights.org/talks/thesis/index.html">Mark Miller&#8217;s thesis</a> (haven&#8217;t finished yet, but still working on it) and to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7179100659758053865">watch</a> <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8527120258517176598">some</a> <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8799856896828158583">other</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbmMPlCp3U">talks</a>. It also led me to read about <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/petnames/IntroPetNames.html">petnames</a>, <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2009/HPL-2009-169.html">rich sharing</a>, <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Alan_Karp/site_password/">website passwords</a>, <a href="http://web-send.org/introducer/">web introducer</a> and <a href="http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-report/html/index.html">many</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBqeDYETXME">other</a> <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7EKeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html">interesting</a> <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Security-vs-Security-Architecture">things</a>.</p>

<p>There are years of serious research poorly summurized in the links above. I highly encourage to read and watch all of this, but I admit it takes a lot of time to.</p>

<h2>Thousands of credit cards numbers stolen during the Sony Playstation network hack</h2>

<p>People have given their credit card number to Sony. Sony got hacked. People were annoyed. Who is to blame? Sony for its flawed security? Let&#8217;s take another look at the problem.</p>

<h3>I want to pay&#8230;</h3>

<p>I want to pay online. I want to buy one item once or pay regularly (like in a monthly payment to Sony). What option am I given? Giving my credit card number. And this is a terrible idea!</p>

<h3>&#8230;but not to give my credit card number!?</h3>

<p>When I send my credit card number and any &#8220;secret&#8221; written on the card, I do not allow for a <strong>one-time payment</strong> (or regular) to <strong>one company</strong> for a <strong>given amount of money I choose</strong>. Rather, I give the authority to anyone reading my info to do a payment of <strong>any amount</strong> directed <strong>to anyone</strong>, <strong>anytime</strong>. And that&#8217;s a source of insecurity.</p>

<h2>Another way of thinking online payment</h2>

<p>Here is how payment <em>could</em> happen: I go to my bank website, I have a form where I choose the amount I want to pay, who I want to pay to and to which frequency (one time, once a month, etc.). The two last fields are optional. In exchange, the bank gives me a secret (a URL for instance). I share this secret with who I want to pay. End of story.</p>

<p>Of course, this is just an example crafted in 2 minutes that could probably be improved.</p>

<h3>&#8220;Oh fuck! Sony is getting hacked again!&#8221;</h3>

<p>So, In my imaginary world, Sony (or anyone, it&#8217;s not about Sony as you&#8217;ve understood) does not have access to my credit card number, but only to a secret allowing a payment only to it at a frequency that I chose and to an amount that I chose as well. Sony gets hacked? <strong>WHATEVER!</strong></p>

<p>We could imagine extensions where I could tell my bank &#8220;such secret has been compromised. Please stop paying through it&#8221;, &#8220;regenerate a secret for the same parameters&#8221;, etc.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As Ben Adida mentions in <a href="http://benlog.com/articles/2011/12/21/encryption-is-mostly-not-magic/">his blog post</a>, encryption is not the final answer to security. His analysis of how encryption may get in the way of social features is interesting.</p>

<p>I wrote this post to show that security without encryption can exist, even for payments. Object capabilities seems to have a huge misknown and underused potential to achieve this form of security.</p>

<p>In the particular case I described, it&#8217;s not here because it requires cooperation from banks. I&#8217;m looking forward to see banks implementing this!</p>
