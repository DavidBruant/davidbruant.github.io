          <h2>Array.forEach() &#8211; a better abstraction may lead to better performances</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Sep 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>We have seen in the first article about forEach that this method helps writing code with a better abstraction. This helps the human being. It could also be used by the interpreter to improve performance. Let&#8217;s see this with an example :</p>

<p>[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;on&quot;]<br>
var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6];<br>
// turn each element of the a array into its square<br>
a.forEach( function(e){return e*e;} );<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>Even though ECMAScript imposes forEach to process elements in the array order, we can clearly see for this particular example that there is no need for such a guarantee and the result would be exactly the same if the elements were visited in any order.<br>
With such a freedom, we could imagine an interpreter opening several threads (maybe not for a 6-element array, but you get my point), equally distributing the workload across the threads and finishing the forEach call after the last thread has finished.<br>
If we have the guarantee that the forEach call result is independent of the visit order, there is not even a need to protect the array with a mutex since the writings on the array are independent.</p>

<p>Of course, it is quite easy to build an example where the order matters.<br>
[sourcecode language=&quot;javascript&quot; light=&quot;on&quot;]<br>
var a = [1,2,3,4,5,6];<br>
// turn each element of the a array into itself times the previous element<br>
a.forEach( function(e, i, a){ return i===0 ? e : e*a[i-1];} );<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>

<p>In this example it is quite clear that the dependence in the previous computation makes impossible to parallelize the forEach call.</p>

<p>Of course, allowing parallelization also depends on the array forEach is called on. And the following step/question is : for which pair of (functions, array) provided as argument to forEach (the array as the <code>this</code> object) can the call be parallelized and for which isn&#8217;t it possible ?<br>
Since the arrays can vary a lot, a more interesting question is : for all array, for which functions provided as argument to forEach can the call be parallelized and for which isn&#8217;t it possible ?</p>

<p>This seems to be like a very complicated static analysis question and I won&#8217;t try to answer it. The potential exists though.</p>
