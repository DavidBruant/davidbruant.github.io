So, yesterday, the following has been done:

*   Bookmark cleaning and creation of a page for colleagues with technical-related pages/documents. I personnally recommend reading: 
    *   [Mobiles Megatrend 2011][1]. Especially slides starting at 42.
    *   [Dive into HTML5 &#8211; A Quite Biased History of HTML5][2]
    *   [Article on hash-bang urls][3]
    *   [From E to ECMAScript][4]. A Mark Miller talk. It discusses security in Object Oriented languages and applications to securing ECMAScript.
*   Join Mozilla. I have filled a [couple of bugs][5] and discussed them.  
    I am particuarly proud of the resolution of [2 issues with the &#8220;Mozilla privacy policy&#8221; link][6]. Basically, due to technical contraints, I have suggested an HTML hack which aims at closing a label tag earlier in order to fulfill functional requirements. HTML validator report an error, but the features are the expected one. [&#8220;It&#8217;s not a bug, it&#8217;s a feature&#8221;][7]
