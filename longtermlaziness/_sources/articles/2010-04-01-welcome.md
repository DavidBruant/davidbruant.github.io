Back in time, at ENSEIRB, my engineering school, one professor of mine used to say that &#8220;computer scientist&#8221; is a job for lazy people. We care about computers because they do computations for us, because they carry information and transmit information for us.

The more we work today to make those computers working, the more we can rely on them to do the computations and the more we can do something else.

The more we spend time designing a system, separating it into independant modules, the less time we will spend maintaining.

The more time we spend knowing what we want to achieve and specifying it properly and the more time we spend knowing the technologies in depth, the less time we will spend debugging.

Working hard today for a long-term laziness.
