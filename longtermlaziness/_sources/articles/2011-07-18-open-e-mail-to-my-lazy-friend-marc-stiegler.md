Dear Marc,

I guess I should start by apologizing. I know we have never met and it is weird of a thing to do to start a conversation with someone with a blog post. I also apologize to call you &#8220;friend&#8221;, because not having discussed at all cannot really make us friend. But I feel that there is some sort of connexion, some way of thinking that we share for which we certainly are already &#8220;lazy friends&#8221; and I thought I should explain it and share with other people.

The most I have seen of you is your incredible talk entitled [The Lazy Programmer&#8217;s Guide to Secure Computing][1]. And it blew my mind. See, my blog is entitled &#8220;long term laziness&#8221; and your talk clearly showed that we&#8217;re on the same page when it comes to laziness.

A lot of people are lazy in this word, but very few understand that there are different ways to be lazy and you captured it perfectly by distinguishing what you called &#8220;amateur lazy programmer&#8221; and &#8220;professional lazy programmer&#8221;. You describe the state of mind of the latter as:

> I know that if I don&#8217;t do this right the first time. I can spend an extra half hour now or spend a week of agony tomorrow.

And this is a way of life as far as I&#8217;m concerned. We apparently use different terminology. I say &#8220;long term&#8221;, you say &#8220;professional&#8221;, but I know we&#8217;re on the same page.

Overall, it was very fascinating to see how good practices of object-oriented programming turn out to be security features. I had never thought about object-oriented programming this way.

I have showed your talk to a very good friend of mine and the envelope metaphor blew his mind as much as it did to me the first time I saw it. Then, I thought &#8220;oh well, that was the big time of his talk, I won&#8217;t learn much from now on.&#8221;. And I did kept learning, until the last minute.

I really loved the part when you explain what to say to brainwash programmers so that they&#8217;d make programs easier to write viruses against. I wouldn&#8217;t have expected &#8220;Use C or C++&#8221; as the very first rule, but your explanation makes a lot of sense.  
Also, I have programmed in CakePHP once and at the time, seeing that they had a [security class][2] really did leave me a bad taste in the mouth. I&#8217;m glad I was not crazy on this one and that having a &#8220;security module&#8221; in a program is an aberration to a security guru.

Also, the Buffy Summers quote at the end was brilliant!

When I think about it, it makes a lot of sense that you did this talk. Educating people to do less mistakes is so much more lazy than fixing all of these mistakes! I do thank you to have taught me so much in this one-hour video. I certainly be even more careful than I was before when writing programs.

Keep being lazy and inspire people to be so too!

Lazily,

David
