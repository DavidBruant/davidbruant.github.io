Hey Lazies !

I&#8217;ve been participating to the first [Mozilla documentation sprint][1] ever this week-end.  
Instead of blogging about couple of stuff I&#8217;ve been working on/learning/documenting, I prefer providing you the links:

*   [ECMAScript 5 strict mode][2]
*   [Object.defineProperty][3]

It doesn&#8217;t sound a lot, but now, both pages are quite complete with examples and stuff.

Thanks to Moz folks for the week-end!
