# Beyond source code licence

The MailPile team [is calling for a vote on its 1.0 licence](https://www.mailpile.is/blog/2015-05-08_Choosing_a_License.html). The blog post and [corresponding Twitter "discussion"](https://twitter.com/MailpileTeam/status/596676991786561536) contain the regular elements of discussion. This post is an attempt at putting an end to some of them and broaden the scope of the discussion on some others.


## Users freedom

> Some licenses, especially those championed by our friends at the Free Software Foundation, are designed to protect the rights of the end-user and ensure that community efforts remain with the community. The AGPLv3 is the most modern and powerful such license, designed for software like Mailpile.

The choice of the licence is irrelevant to the vast majority of end-users freedom. The vast majority aren't free to the extent they understand the licence and can read the source code. They're free to the extent that they trust the person or organisation that told them about the software.

Of the 500 million people who use Firefox over IE, Safari or Chrome, it's likely 99% don't know what source code is, are oblivious to the idea of open source licences let alone differences between such licences. As far as they are concerned when downloading a piece of software, open source or not is the same thing. Mozilla managed to build trust via brand awareness, not via chosing an (or... well... designing their own) open source licence.

Brief mention that not only the vast majority of users cannot understand and the rise of Chrome indicates they actually don't care. We could pretend we know better and make "good" choices on their behalf, but we'd be as pretentious and disrespectful as  the proprietary folks or the NSA with mass surveillance.

Let's stop pretending this debate is about end users, it is not. The vast majority of users cannot understand the difference and it will remain so probably for the next ~80 years (at which time, better federated or distributed technologies will have emerged and we won't even remember what this email thing is).


## Fighting against Big Corporation™

> Today Safari and Chrome (...) are proprietary programs and the community does not have access to their inner workings. Amongst other things, this means the community cannot easily inspect or audit how and when these browsers "phone home" and share private data with the companies that wrote them.

> It can also be argued Webkit's license perpetuates the status quo and unfairly skews the market against truly free software. Compared with these truly free alternatives, Chrome and Safari will always have a head start because Google and Apple can keep some of their innovations to themselves.

> Of course the counter-argument is, that without the motivation for big companies to collaborate, Webkit probably wouldn't exist at all.

This description is upside down and biaised towards Webkit point of view.

Safari and Chrome aren't about Webkit or KHTML. There are two companies which wanted each to make a proprietary browser and them thought about what would be the most efficiently way to do so. KHTML was around, so Apple used that to get a product off the ground more quickly. They chose to keep the purely technical, non-core-business parts open source, because the benefits of this choice largely outweighs the costs.

What matters here is that they wanted to make a proprietary browser. KHTML, then Webkit was around and had a licence that fitted Apple then Google needs. Had it not been the case, they would have chosen Gecko (Firefox rendering engine) or would have created something from scratch.
Safari and Chrome were never about KHTML and Webkit.


## Fighting against Big Corporation™ returns

And yet, if they choose not to give a shit, they won't. Not allowing them to reuse the code in their terms just postpones the inevitable. They will rewrite the code anyway if they want to release the product.

Is only postponing worth it?

There are also Big Corporation™ who do play the open source game fairly. They don't open source everything, but they do open source a lot, contribute back to the community. There are also Smaller Corporations™ on each side.

The actors who play along either by contributing patches, sending feedback to mailing lists, filing issues, etc. should they have
