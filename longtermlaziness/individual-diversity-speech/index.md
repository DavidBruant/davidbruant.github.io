<p id="preamble">
  This document is a speech I (David Bruant) have given on May 2nd 2010 during the Spring quarter <a href="http://ihouse.ucsd.edu/programs/sunday-supper.html">Sunday Supper</a> at the Great Hall of <a href="http://ucsd.edu/"><abbr title="University of California, San Diego">UCSD</abbr></a> <a href="http://ihouse.ucsd.edu/"><abbr title="Interational House">iHouse</abbr></a>

Hi, for those who don&#8217;t know me yet, I&#8217;m David, I live in iHouse since Fall quarter.

Tonight, I would like to create emotions in you. First of all, I would like to create *deception* in you,  
then *surprise* you. Finally, I hope to make you more *curious* than you were entering the Great Hall  
tonight.

I would like to talk about *diversity*. This is the deception part of my speech. I already know what  
most of you think <q>iHouse, diversity, we already know the lyrics of that song</q>. And I think exactly the  
same. Before arriving here, I was very attracted by this diversity. Cultures, nationalities and why not,  
skin/eye/hair color, religion. Though, at the beginning of the year, I realized that we were all students,  
about the same age. The conversations were weirdly all the same: <q>Hi, I&#8217;m David</q> <q>Where are you from?</q>  
<q>What&#8217;s your major?</q>.

Then I thought <q>Is it really the advertised diversity?</q>. I was disappointed by what I call now the  
*&#8220;superficial diversity&#8221;*. But I want to talk about diversity anyway and this is the surprise part of the  
speech.

After the beginning of the year, I began to meet *individuals*. What I want to share with you tonight is  
this habit of mine to notice details about people, about these individuals. Those details may be daily  
routines, something liked or disliked, a passion, a past-time, a state of mind. Those details which tell  
more about you than the country you are from, what you study.

<p style="text-indent:0;">
  This year, I have met&#8230;
</p>

<ul id="people">
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this girl with strong political convictions and ready for revolution and is always looking for<br /> alternative solutions. About food, about economics, politics. Even her computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this boy who plays the guitar and chose<br /> <abbr title="International Walk. A walk at iHouse">iWalk</abbr> as his favorite stage. He keeps falling in love<br /> with almost any French girl he meets.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this girl, half crazy, half sexy, an hidden painter who loves chocolate as much as I do.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this boy who is so passionate by his mother tongue that he keeps a book with beautiful but<br /> rarely used words.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this boy who decided to let his beard growing throughtout the year. And by the way, guys<br /> with beards are the coolest ones. He is always ready to accept crazy challenges like singing in Korean<br /> or to walk on all fours for a fashion show.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this happy girl. Hmm&#8230; &#8220;Happy&#8221; may not be enough to describe her. When you are around<br /> her, you may have the impression that she could be the source of happiness on Earth. No matter the<br /> quantity of work she has, no matter the rush she is in, she always has this true smile and true laugh.<br /> Another detail about her, she can change her outfit four times a day.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this girl who is so frightened by death that she studies bioengineering to face this issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this boy who is always complaining about everything but is one of the most interesting<br /> person to talk to when it&#8217;s about education.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this energic girl who wants to know how to say &#8220;elephant&#8221; in every single language.<br /> I&#8217;ve met this girl. When you look at her, you can see a girl who is not the most smiling one, who<br /> might not look like the most enthousiastic one, but she has dreams. One of them is to play piano, all<br /> alone, along the beach.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this boy, occasional patio drummer, activist always ready to fight for causes he finds right.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve met this boy who is very careful about moon cycles and weather to make sure he takes<br /> amazing landscape or building pictures.
  </li>
</ul>

I have met a lot of fantastic people this year, but all the mentioned details are from people I have met  
through iHouse. They might be your roomate, your *noisy* upstairs neighbour, why not your RA,  
someone you saw once on iWalk or someone you might have met at a party.

It&#8217;s been a while now that I have stopped asking new people I meet where they are from and  
what is their major, because I have realized that it is not what matters to me; it is insufficient to define  
anyone.

Tonight, I hope to have made you more curious about what I would call *&#8220;individuals diversity&#8221;*.

Thank you.
