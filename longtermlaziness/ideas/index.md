## What is this?

I have many ideas and not enough time to develop them all. I list in this page these ideas and welcome suggestions, propositions of collaboration, etc.

## Ideas

*   crawler with node.js (design already done. need time to implement) 
    *   Web[Dasher][1] 
        *   [PetName][2] add-on. Associate a domain name with a petname so that visiting this domain displays the petname in the address bar. When visiting a phishing domain, I can see right away that my petname is not displayed and be aware that it&#8217;s likely to be phishing. For instance, for my bank, I can display &#8221; Bank &#8221; as a petname instead of the banque domain. Could be done as a jetpack add-on as soon as the [Awesome Bar API is released][3]. 
            *   A cool add-on which incorporates the notion of [site password][4] 
                *   Unique secret as add-on preference 
                    *   On input[@type=password], replace with my own div. Background is linear gradient with 2 colors chosen by the user (anti-phishing). Propose the domain as site name. 
                        *   if there is already a password, propose it in priority. </ul> 
                            *   Timeline debugger</ul>
