title: An emotions- and consent-aware reading of agile and scrum
---

## Context

**Emotions** are things that one feels and that are usually triggered by an external stimuli rather than controlled internal ones

Some emotions are hard to live like fear, pain, shame, frustration and people usually try to prevent or heal them. For the sake of simplicity, these will be called "negative emotions" thereafter

Someone's **consent** is respected when they don't do anything they don't want to do. This definition contains a trick in that it assumes the person knows whether they want to do something any time they're being proposed something

In [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_privilege) countries, most (?) work environments consider *emotions* to be an individual's concern. As such, emotions are expected to not affect the workplace\
Also, most [employment contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract) carry a **subordination** relationship. This usually means that the *employer* can ask anything to the *employee* (within the boundaries of the law) regardless of the employee's *consent*


Sarah Mei already provided a reading of [Agile through the lens of power dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL-6RCTywbc). This article will not get into details about this and focus on emotions and consent


## Agile

The reference text is the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

### Values

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> Working software over comprehensive documentation
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> Responding to change over following a plan

Nothing here refers directly to caring of people emotions or consent

"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"\
This carries the idea of not having to be imposed processes and tools that the individuals wouldn't consent to. But it also leaves in a blind spot how the interactions would work, whether subordination is okay, whether it's okay that people with [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) can be disadvantaged during interactions

"Working software over comprehensive documentation"\
This phrase depends on the definition of "working" and leaves aside who decides what it means and how it is decided, whether everybody consents to working towards this "working"

"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"\
This sentence introduces the notion of *customer* which isn't defined anywhere. According to the definition [found on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer), this implies a monetary relationship\
The idea of "collaboration" over "negotiation" suggests a relationship made of listening on both ends and is likely to open discussion on one's consent wasn't respected or that negative emotions emerged or may emerge

"Responding to change over following a plan"\
This part seems to be driven by the idea of consent. Instead of conforming to a plan that individuals don't consent to follow, freedom is given to diverge from the plan\
When change is frequent and highly unpredicatable, "Responding to change" may contain its amount of stress, incomfort and demotivation; this is not addressed


### Principles 

http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 

**highest priority**

This undefined "customer" again\
This "customer" who is paying seems to be considered important given its satisfaction is considered the highest priority by the Agile principles

Given this is the "highest priority", here is an (incomplete) list of things that are consequently considered less important because they might get in the way of customer satisfaction: 
- all individuals participating in the construction and delivery of the software consent is respected at any given moment
- individuals participating in the construction and delivery of the software don't feel negative emotions along the way
- questionning the ethics of the purpose
