## Accepting others

Differences between human beings exist. They shouldn't be a reason for arbitrary differences in treatment.

Upon agreement with this principle, the following rule can be inferred: never set your expectations on others, on how they should be living their lives... unless in defense of this rule

You shouldn't tell women what they wear or have expectations over it, be frustrated, disappointed, it's not your problem<br>
You shouldn't tell whether women should keep a child they're not ready to care for. Not your body, not your opinion<br>
You shouldn't assume whether the tenant will pay rent or not based on skin color<br>
You shouldn't expect homosexuals to change or be any different. Who they prefer doesn't take anything from you. Not your problem<br>

You shouldn't be caring about what happens to others as long as it doesn't affect you. Making assumptions about others and expecting them to follow them can only lead to suffering.
