# A plan to move away from Google Software

Google Docs, Google Spreadsheet, Google Draw, Google Slide are good software. They have state-of-the-art user experience especially with multi-user real time collaboration. They also come with 3 major drawbacks:
- the data one generates with them is primarily stored on Google servers (accessed via Google Drive)
    - no easy alternative storage
- they're closed-source
    - no one can adapt the software for their needs
- they're SaaS
    - Google unilaterally decides what to update, when they release the update. They may cancel these softwares any day

Moving away from these softwares is hard because of a couple of reasons:
- moving all the data from Google Drive manually is a time-consuming and annoying task
- the new software would need to be at least as good as Google Saas softwares from the user experience with multi-user real time collaboration

These two problems can be solved separately:
- create a backuping software
