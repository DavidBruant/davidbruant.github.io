title: Thoughts on what comes after open source
---

In a blog post, Steve Klabnik [wonders what comes after open source](https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-comes-after-open-source)

In his blog post, he exposes one root problem he sees in how "free software" and "open source" are defined. They are framed as a legal solution (licences) to the problem of software sharing/distribution. And he argues this solution does not answer what most developers think of when they think about open source as a production problem, not as a distribution problem

i think there is a deeper problem which is a broad spread of "no-consent culture" (which is a generalized version of [rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture))
Here consent is defined as a generalized "yes means yes"

In the case of software starts at copyright law which gives a person total control over what others can or cannot do with this person's creations. If they want to forbid you to adapt their creation to your context, they can.

The initial "free software" movement could have gotten to the route of "hey, knowledge distributon should not be limited, let's give everyone every right" (which is the Creative Commons Zero licence). But that's not what happened. Instead the open source movement started by accepting and relying on copyright law to add subtle restrictions about how and when you can and cannot use the source code

Then the "new generation of open source" comes along and they have apparently expectations that a project should have a bug tracker and maintainers should answer promptly and should accept people ideas/pull requests or at least, should be available to answer every proposal
Or that some company should not be allowed to use some code, but some other companies are ok

The common element in all this is one person wants to have control over another person. What they can and cannot do, what they should do
