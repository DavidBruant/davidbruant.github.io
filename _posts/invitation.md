title: The invitation
---

In early March 2018, i was in Canada and visited [David Humphrey]() and his [class of Open Source]() at [Seneca College](). Among other things, i talked about open standards, open source and [our]() work on [open data in the]() [context of public service]().

I enjoyed all of it, but one conversation with Dave in particular remained in my mind\
It was about how each of us started contributing to open source/standards. 

As far as Dave was concerned, he started contributing to Firefox after a discussion he had with Mike Shaver. Dave suggested a couple ideas and Mike Shaver told him that the ideas were at least worth exploring, then where the code was and that he was available to answer questions on IRC. This invitation is what got Dave Humphrey to start.

As far as i was concerned, i have two such experiences. For the documentation, it was meeting the docs team at the [first documentation sprint in Paris]() that got me started, that made me feel legitimate to contribute, to modify anything at all.

I didn't get invited per se to [es-discuss]() (mailing-list where people discussed the future of ECMAScript, the standard of JavaScript), but [my first message to es-discuss]() received [a friendly answer from Brendan Eich](). This isn't an invitation per se, but was an inviting behavior nonetheless. The very creator of JavaScript and others on the list could have ignored my message. They could have responded that i was a nobody, didn't have the proper diploma or whatever, but that's not what happened. We joked about [a reference to a comics]()

My understanding of Dave Humphrey's class is exactly this. An invitation each student in his class to contribute to open source. An invitation saying each of them is capable and legitimate to contribute

i feel we need more invitations\
i should probably start myself
