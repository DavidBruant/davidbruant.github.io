title: Consent respecting learning
---

I have been teaching various things in formal (software engineering schools, professional training) and informal contexts (colleages, friends, etc.)
I have had the occasion to explore various ways of teaching and realized that not all of them respect the consent of participants

This article lists the conditions that i believe maximize consent (and i believe the long-term effect of learning along the way)


# Conditions of consent-respecting learning

## At the learner's pace

Everyone has limited cognitive capabilities and starts from a different point. As a consequence, every person learning will arrive at a different point even if the "teaching is the same"

I believe people learn best when their pace is respected

Limited cognitive capabilities also means that there is a limit to what someone can learn in a day or in a week. I believe pauses are a part of the learning process. When i was giving 3-day trainings, i considered the nights to be the most important time of the training


## Different styles of learning


## Being aware of the power dynamics


## Safe space

- group effect


# Evaluation of various contexts with regard to consent

## Learning on your own

## Western education classroom

## Professional training

## Personalized learning
