title: A world without apologies and forgiveness

Ruby does something that is hurtful to Sapphire

In western societies (probably of heavy Judeo-Christian influence) for the matter to be resolved, Ruby should **apologize** to Sapphire and Sapphire should **forgive** Ruby. There is no resolution if there isn't an apology and forgiveness
Depending on the power dynamic and how much hurt happened, maybe Sapphire will **punish** Ruby

Among other things this leads to ["right" and "wrong" *apologies*](https://twitter.com/BadBunnyTwitch/status/1183614332573114368) and a strange situation when *forgiveness* does not happen

## Analysis of the apology&forgiveness protocol

### An apology is an intention

> The goal of apologizing is generally forgiveness, reconciliation and restoration of the relationship between the people involved in a dispute.
