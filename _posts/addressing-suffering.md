## Addressing suffering

Working towards the [overarching goal of reducing suffering](./overarching-goals).

On the causes of suffering, a first division that can be made:
* caused by other humans
* not caused by another human

Other divisions could be found, but this one is important because most suffering is caused by other humans [citation needed]. Suffering caused by humans is also the most lilely to be addressable.

The next step when witnessing suffering is to heal it

band-aid

The problem with band-aids is that in many occasions, the source of suffering isn't addressed and will strike again

There exists a temptation to work only on studying and addressing root causes, however, this process can be extremely long. Band-aid are necessary in the meantime
