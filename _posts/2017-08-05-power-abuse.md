In order to address suffering, [analysing and addressing root causes](./addressing-suffering) is necessary.

Power abuse is a very common root cause of suffering.

### Understanding power

> power is the ability to influence or outright control the behavior of people

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political))

> power is the ability to influence or outright control the behavior of a person or a thing

the extended definition i'll be using

Power by itself or most often its abuse, even unintentional, lead to suffering. It becomes necessary to study power, how someone ended up acquiring it, how to prevent abuse, misuse, how to revoke the power of those who abuse it

### Structure of power

> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights... and in power

Not what is written in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) and not even true, but let's pretend it is for a minute

Power is a set of things we can call *capability* (in lack of a less ambiguous word). HUman beings can choose to "activate" them, like grabbing an object with their hands. Through an initial set of capabilities that out body and minds offer, we can acquire other capabilities via training our minds and bodies, via learning, via combinaision, via exchanging with other human beings
