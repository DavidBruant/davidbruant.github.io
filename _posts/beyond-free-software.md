# Beyond the 4 rules of free software

With the notion of free software (which is different than *[open source]*), i've met a world i could be aligned with. People who create would bet on collaboration instead of competition.

Free software, as defined by the FSF, is based upon 4 rules:
TODO

however, my own practice and experience led to discovering how these rules are limited in what they allow or don't allow to express. 

[Various licences are considered as free software] and are based upon answering some additional questions. This post explores these questions.

## Freedom to re-licence

CC-SA

## Excluding some people

- left-pad
- limiting to people with other motives (google memo, nazis)
- preventing commercial use (CC-NC)

## Reach and limits of a licence

- Licence is legal. 
- Defense requires a laywer
- Need for a subtler text than a licence that conveys the culture, that conveys things that cannot be defended legally because it describes things that are legal but considered [inappropriate](xkcd freedom of speech). In many instances, this idea has materialized in the idea of a [code of conduct]. This exists in [conferences] and open source projects.
