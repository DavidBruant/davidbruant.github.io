title: Leaving Facebook and Twitter
---

I think i never cared much about Facebook or Twitter being advertisement platforms using our most intimate sharings and conversations to make the targeting efficient. I didn't really care about the privacy violation because i knew it wouldn't last too long. This was all a mostly virtual data/money ecosystem. Yet another way for some people to capitalize power, sad, but nothing really new

I started to care when i saw a message from Facebook on a [European Election Day in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_European_Parliament_election) reminding me to go vote. Facebook has enough data to know who will vote what with excellent accuracy. What if they chose to show this message to only some people. Would they sway an election?

And then a [Facebook employee asked Zuckerberg](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-employees-asked-mark-zuckerberg-if-they-should-1771012990) if they should do something to prevent Trump from being elected. They are very much aware of the power in their hand\
[Cambridge Analytica was too](https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigation)\
Suddenly, it is violently proven that these platforms have the power and can be (ab)used to sway an election as we've seen with Trump and Brexit

It took me some time to get to it, but i decided to leave Facebook. It was not an easy task and i will explain here how i extracted myself from it in hope it will be hopeful to others

While i was in the process of leaving, i came across an article about [content moderators](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona). It provides details on what content moderation is: seeing images and videos of rape, extreme violence, executions, etc. all day long. The article describes the effects of content moderation to people doing it. Various mental illnesses, suicide. Even the working conditions are garbage
After a bit of thinking, this sounds inevitable. Facebook, Twitter, make money out of user-generated content. They are required by law in all countries to prevent the publication of some forms of content (pornography, hate, extreme violence, etc.). Even the best machine learning algorithm cannot do all this work perfectly, even after it will have been trained for a long time. Humans will always be necessary, especially at the scale of billions of users uploading content onto these platforms. To accomodate the law and their business model, it will always be necessary for Facebook and Twitter to pay some humans to consume this content all day long, to break some people in an irreparable way

I don't want to be complicit of this any longer. This was the last straw
