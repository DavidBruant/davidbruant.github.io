My static website
===

I currently have Wordpress blogs which aren't quite easy to work with, aren't flexible enough, don't provide good analytics.
Making a static website.

Making a [static blog generator](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/31/why-my-blog-uses-my-homegrown-python-static-site-generator/) mostly for fun.


## TODO

### Before release

* Add JSON metadata per article
** writing date
** meta description
** title
* Add Google Analytics (and warning in &lt;footer>)
* Add old articles (and add a note on all Wordpress articles)

### After first release

* Keep the sources in the repo (`_sources` directory). In the sent HTML, add a link to the source files
* Add an `about` page
* Make a list of article in main page
* 404 tries a Google Search within the blog
* Twitter cards
* Facebook sharing metadata thingy
* Ajouter date de dernière modification basée sur commits Git
* Ajouter remerciements aux contributeurs sur cet article (~"git blame")
